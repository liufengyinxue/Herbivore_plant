# Herbivore_plant
The numerical models are peroformed in three different computing environment, i.e., MATLAB2019b, cupy, and pyopencl, respectively. 
Use "Grazing_CPU_movie.m" to watch the movie of the simulation in MATLAB.
Use "Grazing_GPU.m" to generate the data from the simulation in MATLAB.
Use "Herbivore_Plant_cupy.ipynb" to generate the data from the simulation in Jupyter lab (or Jupyter notebook) with python. 
Use "Herbivore_Plant_pyopencl.ipynb" to produce Figure 4B of the paper in Jupyter lab (or Jupyter notebook) with python.
Use "Circularly_averaged_structure_factor_raster.m" calculate structure factors of spatial pattern.
Use "Raster_TL_DF_Convolution.m" calculate density flucutation of spatial pattern.
"Spatial_wavelength.zip" gives an example to compute spatial wavelengths of spatial patterns, please follow the procedures in the document.
